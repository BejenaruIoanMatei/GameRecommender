# GameRecommender

## Project Description:

GameRecommender is a FastAPI-based backend API that provides game recommendations based on a given title.

It supports two different recommendation algorithms: Nearest Neighbors and Cosine Similarity, trained on game metadata.

The API returns a structured JSON response and handles errors gracefully when the requested title is not found.

Comes with: Spring Boot-based frontend client: [Game Recommender Client](https://github.com/BejenaruIoanMatei/GameRecommenderClient)

## Features

- Fast and lightweight API built with FastAPI
- Two recommendation strategies: Nearest Neighbors and Cosine Similarity
- JSON response structure suitable for frontend consumption
- Easily extendable with new recommendation logic

## Extras
- Contains a Jupyter notebook showcasing the data analysis process on the Steam games dataset.
- Useful for understanding the development flow and the reasoning behind the final API implementation.
